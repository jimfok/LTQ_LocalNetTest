# Task Tracker 2025-10-06
- spec:sim-tools
- branch: feature/sim-tools-requirements

## Open Work
1. Implement `src/sim/server.lua` and `src/sim/client.lua` harnesses that wrap existing networking modules for CLI use.
2. Author CLI scripts `scripts/run-room-server.sh` and `scripts/run-room-client.sh` that execute the simulators with the required flags.
3. Add behaviour specs in `tests/sim/` to cover server accept flow and client discovery/join loops using stubs.
4. Document simulator usage in `README.md` under Quickstart Networking and cross-link `spec:sim-tools`.
5. Gate new flows with `./scripts/test.sh tests/sim` in CI notes once specs are implemented.

## Notes
- Capture log format updates in this tracker if TRACE schema changes.
- Revisit `docs/plan/2025-10-06-sim-tools.md` after each milestone to close completed items.
