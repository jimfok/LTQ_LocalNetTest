# Plan Log 2025-10-06
- spec:sim-tools
- branch: feature/sim-tools-requirements
- handoff commands: `./scripts/test.sh tests/sim`

## Intent
- Provide local automation for `Create Room` and `Join Room` behaviours so developers can iterate without multiple physical devices.
- Build lightweight simulators that reuse `src/network` modules to avoid drift from runtime logic.
- Capture CLI entrypoints under `scripts/` for downstream agents to drive from CI or remote shells.

## Tasks
1. Draft `docs/spec/sim-tools.md` describing server and client simulators plus logging expectations.
2. Implement reusable simulator modules under `src/sim/` with deterministic loops suitable for CLI use.
3. Expose shell wrappers `scripts/run-room-server.sh` and `scripts/run-room-client.sh` which execute the simulators using LuaJIT.
4. Add behaviour specs mirroring the modules in `tests/sim/`, referencing `spec:sim-tools` for traceability.
5. Update `README.md` with quick-start instructions and link CLI usage to the spec.
6. Run `./scripts/test.sh tests/sim` to verify the new suite.

## Coordination
- Track day-to-day progress in `docs/tasks/2025-10-06-sim-tools.md` (spec:sim-tools).
