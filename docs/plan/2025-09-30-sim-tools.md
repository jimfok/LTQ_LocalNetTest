- spec:sim-tools

## Objective
Establish a proof-of-concept workflow for the simulation tooling so developers can reproduce matchmaking flows without live clients while validating the renamed actions (**Simulation-Created Room** and **Simulation-Join Room**).

## Milestones
1. **Terminology Alignment**
   - Update `main/ui.gui_script` button labels and `main/main.script` status strings to the new action names.
   - Refresh `docs/spec/sim-tools.md` so the spec mirrors the renamed flows.
2. **Workflow Validation Harness**
   - Land quick-launch placeholders in `scripts/sim-tools/` for the renamed simulator entry points and describe how they pair with the in-game UI interactions.
   - Instrument lightweight logging around room creation/join events (see `main/main.script`) to surface debugging signals during simulations.
3. **Proof-of-Concept Sign-off**
   - Run the three defined validation scenarios and document outcomes, blockers, and follow-up bugs in `docs/tasks/2025-09-30-sim-tools.md`.
   - Summarize findings and readiness in `docs/spec/sim-tools.md`, updating the validation checklist status.

## Execution Notes
- Prefer deterministic scripts under `scripts/` that wrap simulator commands so remote agents can run them without manual UI steps.
- Treat the former `feature/sim-tools-requirements` guidance as merged into this effortâ€”reference `docs/spec/sim-tools.md` for the single source of truth.
- Ensure all commits referencing this effort include the `spec:sim-tools` tag for traceability.
- Coordinate with matchmaking service owners to confirm mock endpoints and room IDs align with production expectations.

## Execution Decisions
- Rely solely on lightweight console logging to flag simulated sessions for this quick proof-of-concept, deferring telemetry plumbing.
- Use a simple manual multi-process setup for the self-test so automation work can wait until after the quick validation.
