 spec:sim-tools client harness placeholder

 Pseudo-code outline:
 * Accept discovery targets, join payloads, and lifecycle hooks from the CLI configuration.
 * Create the simulated client transport and schedule discovery polls.
 * Drive the join flow while capturing structured TRACE entries via logging utilities.
 * Exit when the simulated session completes or a timeout is reached.
