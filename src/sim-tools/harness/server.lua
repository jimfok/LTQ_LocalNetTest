 spec:sim-tools server harness placeholder

 Pseudo-code outline:
 * Accept configuration including discovery transport, port bindings, and runtime duration.
 * Create the room server stub and discovery broadcaster once the CLI hands in options.
 * Iterate the update loop, forwarding events to logging utilities instead of printing directly.
 * Allow cooperative shutdown when a duration expires or a cancellation signal is received.
